# Essentia Audio Analysis Algorithms

This project contains experiments using the Essentia audio analysis library to extract tonal and rhythmic features from music recordings.

The goal of the project is to explore computational music analysis techniques and understand how audio features can describe musical structure.

## Features Implemented

The project includes experiments with:

Tonal features
- HPCP (Harmonic Pitch Class Profile)
- Key detection
- Chromagram
- Chord detection

Rhythmic features
- Beat tracking
- BPM estimation
- Onset detection
- Rhythm extraction

Audio analysis
- spectral peak detection
- harmonic peak analysis
- pitch estimation
- tuning frequency estimation

## Project Goal

This project was developed as part of research and experimentation in Music Information Retrieval (MIR).

It focuses on understanding how algorithms can extract meaningful musical information such as:

- tonality
- rhythm
- harmony
- tempo
- pitch content

from audio signals.
